# ⚠️ NOTE ⚠️
By "modifying" I mean only for fun. Not ever to be used; Which is also why I will only use it for indoor, "fun" hobby use. Since it is a fun project! :)

# The-Drone-Project
The Drone Project! I have bought a drone and will be modding it. Adding servo motor, better flight, range and speed, adding more vision modes to it (camera, IR-camera, Thermal, etc), 


## TODO
- Vision modes
## Normal Modes
  - [x] camera (included by default)
    - [ ] a - above view(A)
    - [x] b - front view (F)
    - [x] c - below view (B)
    - [ ] d and e - edge view (LR)
  ## Special Modes
  - [ ] IR vision
  - [ ] thermal vision
  - [ ] radar 
  - [ ] sonar(?) (**Echolocation**)

  ## Hardware 
  - [ ] Wings
  - [ ] Turbo/Boost (pressurized air with a motor)
  - [ ] grip-claw (servo motor)
  - [ ] extra fan

# Extra goal
- [ ] AI



# DISCLAIMER
Obviously, there is laws about drones, at least where I am at (Sweden), so of course one has to follow the laws; Which is why this will only be a POC, used indoors, not to actually "be used". It's really just a fun project. Could also be some research that is interesting! 
Thanks for reading.
Do check **your** countries laws before trying to replicate this project **or** buy any drone what so ever.
