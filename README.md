# The-Drone-Project
The Drone Project! I have bought a drone and will be modding it. Adding servo motor, better flight, range and speed, adding more vision modes to it (camera, IR-camera, Thermal, etc), 

## TODO
- Vision modes
## Normal Modes
  - [x] camera (included by default)
    - [ ] a - above view(A)
    - [x] b - front view (F)
    - [x] c - below view (B)
    - [ ] d and e - edge view (LR)
  ## Special Modes
  - [ ] IR vision
  - [ ] thermal vision
  - [ ] radar 
  - [ ] sonar(?) (**Echolocation**) <- even if this is for underwater mostly, I took some inspiration from this
